## Analysis

Description: Lena Söderberg's Legacy. Apply the right transforms to the blocks.

Searching who Lena Söderberg gives you a story of how Ph.d researchers in the 1970's used a girl called Lena from a playboy magzine as the test image for their novel and ground breaking JPEG compression algorithm. This being a steg challenge is pretty straight forward. The data is coded in the LSB of the coefficients of the DCT transform used in the compression. But only the coefficients which are >1 are coded with the data.

So uncompress the file, get the coefficients and extract the flag.

All the code for the generation and extraction of the image is in [my github repo](https://github.com/DeathStroke19891/DCT_Steg)
